Getting started with AWS CLI on Ubuntu (Linux) consists of the following steps:

1. Prerequisites
2. Installing the latest version of AWS CLI
3. Configuring AWS CLI (short-term credentials)

## Prerequisites

When running AWS CLI commands, the AWS CLI needs to have access to IAM credentials. It is recommended to not use your `root account` for this as it poses a security risk. If you use regular IAM you would be using long-term credentials which isn't recommended. AWS recommends the use of short-term credentials and this is one of the benefits provided by IAM Identity Center (I already have a post about setting this up). Using this aligns with the security best practices.

Now let's get to the good part!

## Installing the latest version of AWS CLI

1. To install the latest version of AWS CLI, run the following commands on your terminal to download the latest zip file:

```shell
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

2. Use the `unzip` command to extract files from the zip file:

```shell
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

3. Use the following command to install the AWS CLI:

```shell
sudo ./aws/install
```

4. And lastly, check the installed version using the following command:

```shell
aws --version
```

## Configuring AWS CLI (short-term credentials)

Let's use the recommended `short-term` credentials. Here I will show you two ways in doing so:

### Using AWS IAM Identity Center

Firstly, using AWS IAM Identity Center. Note that you would need to have had it enabled to use it.

```shell
aws configure sso
```

_\* SSO start URL [None]: https://your-app-name.awsapps.com/start_

### Using GetSessionToken

Secondly, Using GetSessionToken to get a set of temporary credentials. Let's say that you have configured MFA for your IAM users and want to use short-term credentials for programmatic access. GetSessionToken would return credentials consisting of:

- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key
- Security Token

With the help of AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS), a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for users.

Running the following command:

```shell
aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::0123456789:mfa/testMFA --token-code 123456 -duration 129600
```

_**Note**: Replace_

- `0123456789`: with your AWS arn account ID
- `testMFA`: with your MFA device name
- `123456`: with the MFA code currently displayed on your Authenticator app for the IAM user in question

Would return the following output:

```shell
{
  "Credentials": {
    "AccessKeyId": "my-access-key-id",
    "SecretAccessKey": "my-secret-access-key",
    "SessionToken": "my-session-token",
    "Expiration": "my-expiration-date-time"
  }
}
```

- Configure your `mfa` profile:

```shell
nano .aws/credentials
```

```shell
[mfa]
output = json
region = af-south-1
aws_access_key_id = my-access-key-id
aws_secret_access_key = my-secret-access-key
aws_session_token = my-session-token
```

- Test and see if you're be able to list the s3 buckets within your AWS account:

```shell
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name --profile mfa
```
