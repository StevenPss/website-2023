You're a developer working on this incredible open-source project; you're super excited and can't wait to share it with other developers on GitHub (for source control). However, there's a problem: you don't want others to see your API key out of fear that they may abuse it.

Secrets are about confidentiality, aka 'it's classified' (you see what I did there). As developers, we tend to work a lot with secrets! Secrets about passwords, API keys, and database credentials.

In this blog post, we will look at secrets on API keys via the traditional method versus the AWS Secrets Manager way.

## Traditional method

Let's start off by looking at some code examples:

Take the following next 13 `newsletter` route as an example,

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

const API_URL = `${process.env.EMAIL_API_BASE}api/subscribers`;

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { email } = await request.json();

  if (!email) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Email is required" }, { status: 400 });
  }
  try {
    const res = await fetch(API_URL, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Accept: "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.EMAIL_API_KEY || "You didn't set the API key"}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, groups: [process.env.EMAIL_GROUP_ID || ""] }),
    });

    if (!res.ok) {
      throw new Error(res.statusText);
    }
    return NextResponse.json({ ok: "ok" }, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.log(error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message || error.toString() }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

Please take note of the following environment variables:

- `EMAIL_API_BASE`
- `EMAIL_API_KEY`
- `EMAIL_GROUP_ID`

The `.env` file looks like this:

```js
#Email
EMAIL_API_BASE=
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_GROUP_ID=
```
