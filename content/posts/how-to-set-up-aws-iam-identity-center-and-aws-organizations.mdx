Getting started with AWS IAM Identity Center consists of the following steps:

1. Enable IAM Identity Center
2. Choose an Identity Source
3. Create Users
4. Create an Admin Permission Set
5. Set Up Account Access for the Admin Identity Center User
6. Testing everything!

## Enable IAM Identity Center

To get started, search for AWS IAM Identity Center and click on `Enable`:

You will get a modal window like the one below click on `Continue`:

This will get you set up with AWS IAM Identity Center and also create an AWS Organization for you which you can confirm by searching for AWS Organizations:

## Choose an Identity Center

An Identity Source defines where your users and groups are managed. If you click on `Confirm Identity Source`:

After scrolling down a bit you will see this section:

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/Change+Identity+Source.png" />

1. By default, the source will be Identity Center Directory. This is where you would assign your users and groups as well as configure their level of access.
2. You can change the default source by clicking on `Actions` and clicking on `Change Identity Source`.

You will then see the following page below, you can proceed to configure the source but in our case I will use the default source:

## Create Users

On the side navigation click on `Users` as seen on the image below. The users here are not the same users as the ones created in IAM.

### Click on `Add user`

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/Add+User.png" />

#### Specify user details

#### Add user to groups

We're going to skip this optional step for now.

#### Review and add user

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/Review+and+add+user.png" />

Scroll down a bit and click on `Add user` after reviewing. You will see a One-time password modal window appear:

## Create an Admin Permission Set

Permission sets consists of IAM roles that define the level of access that users and groups have within an AWS account. On the side navigation click on `Permission sets` and on the next page click on `Create permission set`

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/4.+Create+an+Admin+Permission+Set.png" />
<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/Create+permission+set.png" />

#### Select permission set type

We're going to go with the predefined permission set but feel free to try out the custom permission set.

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/Select+permission+set+type.png" />

Scrolling down a bit you will see `Policy for predefined permission set` that consists of AWS managed policies to select from. You can select whatever policy you need set but we will go with `AdministratorAccess` for this one

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/Policy+for+predefined+permission+set.png" />

#### Specify permission set details

By filling in the `Permission set name`, `Description`, `Session duration` which is the length of time a user can be logged on before the console logs them out of their session, and an optional Relay state.

Click `Next`.

#### Review and create

If you're done reviewing click on `Create`

## Set Up Account Access for the Admin Identity Center User

1. Click on `AWS accounts` from the side navigation and
2. Click `Assign users or groups`

#### Assign users and groups to "Your Username"

1. Select the Users tab and select your earlier created user. Click `Next` and Assign permission sets to that user. When done Click `Next`.
2. Review and submit assignments by clicking on `Submit`

## Testing everything!

- Login using your AWS access portal URL - https://your-app-name.awsapps.com/start
  It will ask for your username and password. Make sure to enter the ones that you've copied earlier.

- You will then be required to set up MFA. Select `Authenticator app` and set it up.

Finally, once everything has been set up and you've successfully managed to login you will see the following page:

<img src="https://website-2023-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/posts/how-to-set-up-aws-iam-identity-center-and-aws-organizations/AWS+portal+sso+accounts.png" />

- The other cool benefit of this is that it allows you to use the recommended short-term credentials.

`Congratulations` for making it this far.
